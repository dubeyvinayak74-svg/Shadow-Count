# Shadow-Count
A real-time smart occupancy monitoring system built using YOLO and OpenCV. This project detects people, tracks their movement across an entry/exit line, and calculates the live occupancy inside any space. It also logs data, generates graphs, and visualizes the flow of people for better crowd analysis and management.
